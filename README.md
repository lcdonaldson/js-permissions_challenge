# permissions-challenge

The functionality of this project relies upon a local host and so it is fairly unimpressive as a static page.
However, it functions as follows. Once the users button is pressed the page is populated with users and get permissions 
buttons beside them.
If the get permission button is pressed the permissions for that user are shown as the user list disappears. 
Pressing the get users button again returns you to the first list.
